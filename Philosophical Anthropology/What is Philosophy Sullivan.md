__Wise men__ these were the people in ancient Greek that were able to intelligently manipulate the forces of nature and tracing out the reason for things.
__Wisdom__ is the study of things in their deepest and most general aspects.
## The Origin of the Term Philosopher
__Philosopher___ is someone who searches after wisdom, a lover of wisdom
Only God is truly wise- Socrates
Philosophy seeks to view the entire universe in the light of the fewest possible principles, in the light, if possible, of a single ultimate principle.
## The Meaning of Philosophy In the Wide Sense
Where the scientific specialist concerns himself with a single feature of reality, the philosopher seeks to view the whole of reality in a single comprehensive glance, to organize the aspects of reality to unified word view.
Revealed beliefs rely on the truthfulness of a God who reveals while the principles of philosophy rest on a purely rational foundation.
__Philosophy__ is a sort of higher curiosity whereby we endeavor to dig down to the very root of things and through the exercise of reason try to find out why we hold out basic, most fundamental convictions about the nature of reality.

## Why Study Philosophy
Men philosophize not for purely practical ends but because it brings them pleasure. The arts and philosophy are of such great worth precisely because they are not to be used but to be loved and enjoyed just for themselves.
It is the exercise of these higher powers of knowing and loving that separates man from the lower animals.
## All Men Philosophize
All men philosophize whether they know it or not because in our most commonplace expressions of optimism, pessimism, selfishness, high-mindedness, idealism or cynicism, we carry along with them unacknowledged assumptions about the nature of the universe as a whole and man's place in it.
The most practical and important thing about a man is still his view of the universe - G. K Chesterton
A philosophy is none the less real because it is unrecognized is hidden in the words we speak and write.
Having a philosophy being victim to an unconsciously held philosophy or the philosophy of others while doing a philosophy is freeing our minds by becoming critically conscious of what we hold unconsciously or critically.
The examined life is not worth living - Socrates
Philosophy is the search of the ultimates conducted through reason alone in order to satisfy man's curiosity about himself and the universe of which he is part of.
