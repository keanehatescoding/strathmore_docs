> An individual substance of rational nature

\- Boeithus
This definition underline's the objective existence of the person but fails to acknowledge the '"inner subjective dimensions' and it also excludes the fact that actions that make a person can include all other people.

## The 3 components of Boeithus' definition
1. __Substantiality__ - a substance is something that exists by itself
2. __Individuality__  - something that exists distinct from everyone else.
3. __Rationality/Spirituality__ = the "first formal element of our nature is spirit(the soul) rather than matter
As rational beings, man is a moral agent; only persons(rational beings) can be moral due to this fact man is an object of respect and dignity; superior to animals.
Persons carry out actions as whole i.e. it is not only the soul that acts or the body that acts but the entire person who acts hence the body is equally important 
## The human soul
The soul is the life-giving principle, the vitalizing principle, the principle of life.
> To seek the nature of the soul, we must first premise the soul is defined as principle of life in those things which life

\- Thomas Aquinas
The soul is the substantial form of the body.
The soul is that which gives unity to man. 
- The human body becomes a living body when it is united with the soul.
- Without the soul the body ceases to exist
## How can we know the soul exists?
By analyzing the powers of the soul, we learn about the nature of the soul as the origin of these powers.
Through the spiritual soul we have the rational powers, to think, to love.
