## Factors of Production
1. __Labour__ the reward of labour is __wages/salaries/bonuses__.
2. __Entrepreneurship__ the reward of entrepreneurship is __profit.__
3. __Land__ and the reward of land is __rent__.
4. __Capital__ and the reward of capital is __interest__. 
## Differences between market and command economic systems.
1. Market economies have price mechanism while command have rationing of goods/services when they lack enough for the population.
2. In command econ we have conscription of labour for sectors which lack enough workers while market econ may opt to import expartriates.
3. In command econ sys the gov controls most of the econ resources while in market econ sys economic resources are controlled by firms and households.
4. In command econ sys the fixing of prices and salaries is usually not at equilibrium rates i.e maximum wages and minimum controls and I am assuming for market it vice versa.
5. In command econ sys essential services are provided for by the gov e.g. health, education while in market econ sys essential services may be provided for by the gov or private sector.
6. In command econ sys national wealth tends to be more evenly distributed while in market econ sys it is vice versa.
7. In command econ sys the state provides a check for monopoly power while in market econ sys the state may not provide a check for monopoly power e.g. Safaricom.
8. In command econ sys it usually has a lower rate of interest as compared to a market econ sys with a price mechanism.
9. Economic fluctuations prevalent in market econ sys may be reduced or stabilized through gov intervention.
10. In command econ sys it takes cognizance of all the external costs and benefits of econ activities i.e. a factory may not be built for the social cost on the residence while in market econ this may be ignored because of the concept of private property.
11. In command econ sys, making and implementation of policies is slower compared to market econ in which a firms/households choose what, how and to who to produce to.
12. There is a limit to consumer sovereignty in command econ sys since, the gov decides what to and not to produce while in market econ sys the consumer sovereignty is less limited since firms/households choose what to and not to produce.
13. Command econ sys are usually inefficient as compared to market econ sys since the production of good and services is for the whole and not inspired by self interest.
## Transitioning problems for command --> market econ nations
1. They need to develop a culture of entrepreneurship since the previous sys demotivated the producers as they were producing for the masses.
2. Financial crisis- command econ sys countries are usually poor and need to gather enough resources to start boost production in firms and households.
3. Organised crime, black market, illegal speculation and seizure of public property.
4. Most of the previous produced commodities are no longer needed which in term leads to unemployment- this is made worse through occupational and geographical immobility of labour.
# Characteristics of free market economy
1. Price mechanism
2. Right to own property
3. Governed by self interest
4. Freedom of choice as opposed to command econ sys which have conscription and rationing
5. Competition
## Advantages of free market economies
1. Faster in responding to international economic environment.
2. I works together with the concept of consumer sovereignty which allows households and individuals to decide what they want.
3. Consumer also have a greater choice of products.
4. Firms have a greater incentive to bear risks.
5. They tend to encourage foreign direct investment.
## Disadvantages
1. Tends to give rise to development of monopolies.
2. It does not take in consideration externalities i.e. environmental or social impact of setting up factories.
3. Leads to demerit goods (Goods that are bad for people) e.g. child prostitution, drug trafficking.
4. Merit goods (goods that are good for people) tend to be underprovided, since firms produce for only those that can afford them.
5. It can generate considerable income inequality and wealth.
6. May not produce public goods.
## How the gov in mixed economic systems can influence the allocation of resources
1. Through the use of taxes e.g. taxing foreign goods to reduce competition.
2. Through the use of subsidies e.g. fertilizer subsidies to encourage farmers to grow more crops.
3. Increasing the national spending to strategic industries i.e. investing in fishing industry.
4. Price fixing through the use of max and minimum prices.
5. Using taxes to transfer money from the more fortunate to the less fortunate.
## Limitation of consumer sovereignty
1. Range of goods available
2. Government intervention in providing merit goods.
3. The power of advertising.
4. The existence of monopolies.
5. Consumer habits
6. Provision of standardized goods - i.e. it is easier for firms to produce standardized goods but in doing so consumers' freedoms are limited
7. Fashion and customs- consumers behaviours is linked to the latest trends in society. The reluctance to contravene established conventions my limits consumer freedom to some extent.
