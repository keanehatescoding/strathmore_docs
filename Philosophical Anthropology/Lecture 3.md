The levels of life
## Characteristics of life
1. Self movement
2. Unity
3. Immanence
4. Transendance
5. Self fulfilment
6. Rhythm
Self movement - living beings have the capacity to move themselves naturally.A
Unity - living beings have complex structures but all live in orderly harmony for the sake of the "whole" else they cease to exist.
Immanence - Latin in-manere(to remain in) living beings have the capacity to be interiorly transformed by their own actions e.g. eat, sleep, weep i.e when we learn something it remains in us and enriches our world through memory and imagination. When we learn something the knowledge/ideas/concepts we acquire remain within us and we become more educated.
This actions are auto-referential meaning if they are good they make us better people otherwise they make us worse.
Transendence - capacity to overcome the limits of physical existence through action.
> The openness and breadth as opposed to closure and limited nature non-living beings.
 
 \- Lombo and Russo

> The action of the living transcends the action of nature which operates in inanimate things. 

\- Thomas Aquinas

Self fulfilment - they have the capacity to grow (size) and undergo development (maturity). A child grows to be an adult but his formation never really ends.
Rhythm - living beings are characterized by a regular pattern of events e.g. birth, growth, decay.
Though some machine i.e robots can move their movement is does not originate of their own own intrinsic nature, rather it is extrinsic (it originates from their inventor(s))
## Degrees of life and their characteristics
1. Vegetative life
2. Sensitive life
3. Intellectual life
## Vegetative life
Vegetative life is characterized by growth, nutrition and reproduction. In plants these functions are fixed and associated with certain fixed movements if fixed i.e through water or to seek light. While in animals and humans they also have vegetative functions but they animals use their senses(sensitive) to discern what look for food while humans use their intellect and will to decide what to/not to eat.
## Sensitive life
Sensitive life is characterized by the ability to sense external qualities (stimuli) in your surrounding objects and respond to this stimuli(instinct). The system of perception is another characteristic of sensitive life. 
The essential characteristics of sensitive life are 
- Automatism of the circuit stimulus-response (instinct)
Animals have an automatic pattern of behavior shaped by biological necessities such as survival and reproduction i.e a dog will always respond to a call to be fed unless it is sick. An exception of this is the human as he breaks it through will power.
- Intervention of the sense perception 
The response towards stimuli is a result of the process of animals/man's ability to acquire information about their environment through their senses.
- Fulfilment of specific ends
The goal of animals are predetermined i.e no lion would feed on grass

## Intellectual life
Only man is able of grasping and understand both material and immaterial objects i.e truth, beauty and goodness etc.
The automatic circuit of stimuli-response is broken since man is able to use his will and freedom to avoid acting out of pure instinct i.e not to drink contaminated water.
Instinct is completed by learning. He must learn everything: to walk, talk, speak, read and unlike animals he has infinite possibilities to learn.
Man is also capable of not only setting goals(ends) but also means to achieve his goals. Unlike the lion who is forced to hunt whenever it's hungry, man can order fast food, cook food, etc.
