# strathmore_docs
I am currently a first year, first semester student in Strathmore University. I am creating this repo to keep track of my units as a form of back up, revision and who knows maybe even collaboration. I am doing 8 units but one I have not included as it is a supplementary unit with no particular course outline. I use obsidian to write my notes and manage them.
