1. Power rule 
If a function is defined as $$ f(x) = x^n $$  then its derivative is given by  
 $$ f'(x) = {nx}^{n+1} $$
2. Product rule
If a function is defined as $$ h(x) = f(x)\cdot g(x) $$ then its derivative is given by h'(x) = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x) and generally $$ 
h' = f\cdot g' + f'\cdot g $$
3. Quotient rule
If a function is defined as $$ h(x) = \frac {f(x)}{g(x)} $$ then its derivative is given by $$ h'(x) = \frac {g(x)\cdot f'(x) - f(x)\cdot g'(x))} {(g(x))^2} $$
4. The chain rule
If a function is defined as 
$$   h = g(f(x)) $$ 
then the derivative is given by 
$$ h' = g'(f(x))\cdot f'(x) $$
 therefore it can be concluded that
 $$ \frac {dg}{dx} = \frac {dg}{df} \cdot\frac {df}{dx} $$
5.  Derivatives of exponents
If a function is defined as 
$$ f(x) = a^x $$
then the derivative of this function is given by
$$ f'(x) = a^x \cdot ln(a)$$
when a = e a special case occurs 
$$ f'(x) = \mathcal e^x \cdot \ln \mathcal e  $$ 
but $$ \ln \mathcal e = 1 $$
$$ \rightarrow  f'(x) = \mathcal e^x \cdot1 $$$$ f'(x) = e^x $$
 6. Derivative of logarithms 
 If a function is defined as  $$ f(x) = \log_a (x) $$ then the derivative of this function $$ f'(x) = \frac {1}{x\cdot \ln(a)} $$ When a = e $$ f(x) = \log_ex$$ then $$ f'(x) = \frac {1}{x \cdot \ln \mathcal (e)} $$
  $$ f'(x) = \frac {1}{x\cdot 1}$$ therefore $$ f`(x) = \frac {1} {x}$$
 
 7. Limits
 Important limits
 $$ \lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac {\sin x}{x} = 1 $$
$$ \lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac {1-\cos x } {x} = 0$$
8. Derivative of trig functions
$$ \frac {d} {dx} sin(x)= \cos (x)$$
$$ \frac {d} {dx} \cos(x)= -\sin (x)$$
