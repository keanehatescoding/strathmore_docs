I have a dream speech- Martin Luther King 
# Main points 
Eradication of racism
Discrimination
# How did Martin Luther King communicate with his audience.
Story telling to make his story more memorable 
# How did the audience respond to the speech
They applauded at various point of the speech
Nodding in agreement
# How successful you felt the speech and why
Increase in number of people that joined the fight for civil rights
Led to the end  of discrimination
He had a huge impact today
# Your feelings as you either delivered or listened to the speech
Inspired more people to fight for equality in the society
Mad us empathize with the African American community
