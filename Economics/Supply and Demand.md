reasons for the law of demand 
1. Substitute goods - direct relationship between price of a commodity and demand of it's substitute good.
2. Income effect -increase or decrease.
__NB:__ There is a direct relationship between the price of a commodity and the price of its complementary good. Therefore there is a inverse relationship between the price of a commodity and the demand of it's complementary commodity.

5. Seasonal factors
6. Government influence
7. Tastes and preferences
For __normal goods__ - an increase in their income leads to the increase in the demand of the normal good and for an __inferior good__ an increase in their income leads to a decrease in the demand of the inferior good.
##  Law of Supply
#Law-of-Supply states ceteris paribus their exist a direct relationship between the price of a commodity and the quantity supplied. 

## Determinants of Quantity Supplied
1. Price of the commodity
2. Cost of factors of production- increase in price of resources leads to lower profitability which in turn leads to fewer commodities being produced and thus lower quantity supplied.
3. The state of technology- tech improvements leads to more efficient and or cheaper methods of production in turn leads to more production per unit time and thus quantity supplied increases.
4. The expectations of the producers - an increase in the expected future price of a commodity results in the reduction of the current supply.
5. Then number of producers - an increase in the number of sellers results in a increase in the quantity supplied.
6. Seasonality i.e. weather in agriculture
7. Incidence of industrial action or strikes
8. The price of related goods - firms will try to increase the quantity supplied of more profitable goods and reduce the quantity supplied of the less profitable related goods.
## How Supply can be increased
1. Decrease in the price of one factor of production
2. Improved technology
3. Government subsidy i.e. agriculture
4. Reduction in VAT
5. Favourable weather
6. Reduced incidence of strikes
__NB:__ The opposite of the following factors will be responsible for a decrease in supply
## Examples of Price Ceiling
1. Rent control
2. Price controls during war time
3. Gar price rationing
## Examples of Price floor
1. Agricultural price supports
2. Minimum wage laws
## Effects of price decontrol/price liberalization
1. Consumer pay more - prices tends to move towards the equilibrium
2. It encourages greater investment by producers in decontrolled lines of production
3. Encourages research and development in order to improve factors of production.
4. Leads to more efficient allocation of resources in the long run
5. Leads to lower consumer prices in the long run because on increased competition
