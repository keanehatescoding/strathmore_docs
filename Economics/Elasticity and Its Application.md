#Perfectly-Elastic a change in price of the commodity does not affect the demand e.g. insulin 
$\frac {\delta q}{\delta p}= 0$
#Inelastic-demand a change in price of the commodity leads to a small change in the demand of the good e.g. petrol 
$\frac {\delta q}{\delta p}< 1$
#Unit-elastic a change in a unit price of the commodity leads to a same unit change in the demand of the good 
$\frac {\delta q}{\delta p}= 1$
