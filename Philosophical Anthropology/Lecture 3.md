## Characteristics of life
1. Self movement
2. Unity
3. Immanence
4. Transendance
5. Self fulfilment
6. Rhythm
Self movement - living beings have the capacity to move themselves naturally.A
Unity - living beings have complex structures but all live in orderly harmony for the sake of the "whole" else they cease to exist.
Immanence - Latin in-manere(to remain in) living beings have the capacity to be interiorly transformed by their own actions e.g. eat, sleep, weep i.e when we learn something it remains in us and enriches our world through memory and imagination.
This actions are auto-referential meaning if they are good they make us better people otherwise they make us worse.
Transcendence - openness and breadth as opposed to the closure and limited-ness of non living things/ capacity to overcome the limits of physical existence through action.
Self fulfilment - they have the capacity to grow (size) and undergo development (maturity). A child grows to be an adult but his formation never really ends.
Rhythm - living beings are characterized by a regular pattern of events e.g. birth, growth, decay.
Though some machine i.e robots can move their movement is does not originate of their own own intrinsic nature, rather it is extrinsic (it orinigates from their inventor(s))
