1. Natural numbers - counting numbers from 1. 2, 3.  $$ \mathcal N$$
2. Whole numbers - natural numbers including zero $$\mathcal W$$
3. Integers - whole numbers including negative numbers $$ \mathcal Z$$
4. Rational numbers - are numbers of the form a/b where a and b are integers and b <>0
$$ \mathcal Q$$
5. Irrational numbers - when expressed as decimals they neither terminate nor recur. e.g.
$$ \mathcal Q=\{\mathcal \pi, \mathcal e , \sqrt 2, \sqrt 5\} $$
## Proof square root of 2 is irrational
If $\sqrt2$ is even then 
$$ \sqrt2 = \frac {a}{b}$$
$$ \to 2 = \frac {a^2}{b^2} $$
This implies 2 is even in order for it to be rational hence and odd * odd = odd 
$$\to a^2 = 4k \newline \to $$
