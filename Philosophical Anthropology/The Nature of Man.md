## The view of man Changes
Man is one more of the brute animals, a superior animal but still an animal, with the same transitory and questionable value as the other animals. Just as animals are creatures of instinct with no control over their instincts so it is man is impelled purely by the attraction of sense goods and by the blind drive of instinct.
A grosser view is man is a machine consisting of bundles of conditioned reflexes which when you manipulate you manipulate the physical stimuli of man you can control his responses and in a wider sense the society i.e given the proper stimulus, the reflex is mechanic, automatic and foreseeable.
Common to the above of two doctrines are the view man is a freakish, haphazard, evanescent appearance in an ever evolving universe, a being without meaning, without destiny, without hope.

## "Ideas have consequences"
We have reached a point in time where large parts of the world are controlled by men who apply the literally teachings that yesterday belonged to the lecture hall. As a result today, we see manipulation of the entire population as though they were large herds of cattle, we see people used as slave labour and their worth calculated on the cost of feeding them. We see the human personality assaulted and shattered in identical techniques such as the Russian scientist experiments on the conditioned reflex of brute animals. 

## Man is different
Man is a deeply immersed in the impersonal forces of the physical universe for man is, of course, an animal, such as part of the physical universe i.e if he touches fire he will get burnt.
It is erroneous to say man is a mere animal because someone may argue Rembrandt is more than a mere mixture of colors on a piece on canvas because a something shines out of the picture so something shines out of man.
Man is different from animals because he has the power to reason. He can see the sameness in difference which runs though many things, the oneness in many. Man is unique from other animals because in knowing and judging he exalts himself from inexorable law and rigidity of the realm of matter.
Though many philosophers may deny the fact that only man has power to reason and say the usual implication of there is no difference between beyond a rising scale of complexity; there exist a whole range of activities which are there is no parallel in the rest of animal kingdom. 

## Deny Reason, and What Follows?

Deny reason and deny science and philosophy, for you cannot deny reason then decide to use it.
Only man has scientific knowledge of himself, of other animals, of nature itself. Only man can philosophize, because only man sees meaning in the universe and ask questions about it.
No two sensations, however, even in successive instants, are exactly the same. 
> The outward appearance of physical things and the conditions under which they are sensed also subject to the universal law of change 

\- Heraclitus and his followers.

## Comparison between animal knowing and human knowing
Man has arts while animals do not have arts because only man is capable of understanding beauty and re-create the patterns of beauty, imposing new forms on matter. No animals stop to admire the sunset and symphony or painting.
Animal speech is without conscious order, without grammar, it does not write poetry or read books or keep historical records.
The brute animal does not judge itself, does not laugh or pray, it does not have remorse or conscience, conspire to throw old forms of government or experiment with new.
All these things are explainable only on the basis that man has reason, 
Deny to man the power of reason and man becomes impossible to explain, as many fruitless attempts in the history of philosophy tell us.
