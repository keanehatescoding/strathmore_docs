__Philosophy__ comes from the Greek word philosophia which means love of wisdom.
A philosopher is somebody who seeks the truth (Diogenes)
Why is the purpose of philosophy?
Human life may be compared to the public games, some come to compete for honour and the crowns of victory, others to trade, others, for enjoyment similarly in life some work for honour, others profit, a few for truth alone; these are the philosophers.
__Philosophy vs Myths__
Philosophy developed as an attempt toward a rational investigation of the world and of human life as opposed to the explanations from myths/superstitions/beliefs coming from corrupted forms of ancient religions.
Philosophy is the rational investigation of the ultimate(root) causes and first principles of reality
or an attempt to understand the root nature of reality, existence and knowledge.
## Branches of Philosophy
1. Metaphysics - studies the ultimate nature of reality. entails what is real? What makes things real?
2. Epistemology - studies the nature of knowledge and the process of knowledge
3. Ethics - studies the morality of human actions
4. Aesthetics - studies the questions of beauty
4. Logic - studies correct thinking
5. Axiology - studies ethical and aesthetic values
## Relevance of Philosophy
1. Philosophical attitude is fundamental in life
2. Man cannot live an authentic human existence if he does not know himself in his innermost reality
3. It seeks to answer some questions like Who am I ? Why is there evil? What is there after this life?
4. Self knowledge - an examined life is not worth living (Socrates)
__Philosophical attitude__ presupposes a capacity or sense of wonder awakened by the contemplation of reality.
It is because of awe that men begin to philosophize.
## Philosophical Anthropology
Stems out from the two Greek words anthropos (man) and logos(science)  -philosophical anthropology - the study of man
The various forms of social sciences include:
1. __Cultural anthropology__ studies the customs of human societies over time.
2.  __Social anthropology__ studies the dynamics of relations among individuals living in society
3. __Ethnological anthropology__ studies human groups, their shared traits in relation with the geographical, historical and climatic conditions in which they lived.
What is common among these disciplines is they focus on a single or particular aspect about man (customs, relations, group traits)
## P.A vs the social sciences
```table
Philosophical Antropology | Social Sciences
What is human nature | How division of labour was practised among a particular tribe
What is the essence of being a human | How children were educated in this community
What is death | How was illness and death viewed in this community
```
Hence it can be concluded whereas science investigates how the human individual manifests himself towards his environment and his fellow men, philosophy asks about why of human being, about the ultimate principles of existence and activity.
P.A studies man from a holistic perspective therefore it reflects upon man to understand him in his entirety, grasping the fundamental principles of his existence in the world and his behaviour. (Lombo and Russio, p2)
